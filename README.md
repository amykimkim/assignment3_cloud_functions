## Lab Rules - C-reactive Protein (CRP)
I chose to use CRP for this assignment. CRP is a lab-value that is an inflammatory marker. It is a protein produced by the liver that increases if the body produces inflammation due to infection. It can be checked via a simple blood test. It is measured in miligrams per liter (mg/L). Results that are > 8 is considered high/abnormal.
